# Supermarket Emulator

<!-- [TOC] -->

## Current Ideas

> ### **\#420**
>
> **A Function which generates the formatted data of all the people and supermarket classes involved**
>
> The output will probably be stored in a text file in a readable format

> ### **\#421**
>
> **bag.look() Function**
>
> Add a bag.look() function in the Person class so that a person can see the current items that they have in their bag in the present moment

> ### **\#422**
>
> **Function to keep track of stocks**
>
> Adding a feature to keep track of the stocks of induvidual items in supermarkets

> ### **\#423**
>
> **Enabling the admin to restock items in a supermarket**
>
> Thinking of enabling a feature where the admin can add stocks to supermarkets. [Will be working on this after we have implmented idea (#422)/(a system to keep track of stocks)]
